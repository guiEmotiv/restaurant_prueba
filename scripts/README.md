## 🚀 **QUICK START GUIDE**

### 🏃‍♂️ **Fastest Way to Start Development**
```bash
# Option 1: One-click startup from project root (Recommended)
./start-dev.sh

# Option 2: Professional environment manager
./scripts/local/local-dev.sh start

# Option 3: Manual startup (2 separate terminals)
./scripts/local/start-backend.sh    # Terminal 1
./scripts/local/start-frontend.sh   # Terminal 2
```

### 🔧 **Common Development Tasks**
```bash
# Check if services are running
./scripts/local/local-dev.sh status

# View development logs
./scripts/local/local-dev.sh logs

# Restart after code changes
./scripts/local/local-dev.sh restart

# Stop all services
